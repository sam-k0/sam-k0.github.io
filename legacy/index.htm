<h1 id="legacy-gm-yyc-compiler-help">Legacy GM YYC compiler help</h1>
<p>I had some trouble setting up the yyc even though I went through the pain of collecting all legacy Visual Studio versions...
Once I arrived in GameMaker Preferences, set all paths, I clicked &quot;Check&quot;.
Damn, everything OK.</p>
<p>As I tried compiling the whole thing, GM gave me the error &quot;Could not find file&quot;.
I suspect this happens because I tried to compile a project made in GMS Standard Edition,
so in the end I got it fixed by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the paths set up correctly (8.1 Kit and VS 2015, listed as Visual Studio 11 for some reason)</li>
<li>Create a new Configuration (Middle, top of the screen, new config, select create config from default, or whatever your main config is)</li>
<li>Select that config in the dropdown menu (Its not selected by default)</li>
<li>Compile.</li>
</ol>
<p>I still have no idea why this is, but it works and I&#39;m happy.
To whoever is seeing this: I feel your pain. It must have been a long way to find this page...</p>
